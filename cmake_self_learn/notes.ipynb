    "\n",
    "    - **Type of Library**: By default, if you don't specify otherwise, add_library will create a static library. You can also specify SHARED to create a shared library, or MODULE for a module library (which is a plugin and not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime).\n",

If it's a shared library, it would be libyuzhen_function.so, libyuzhen_function.dylib, or yuzhen_function.dll on Linux, macOS, and Windows, respectively.\n",

    "    - **Using the Library**: Once the library is built, it can be linked to other targets (executables or other libraries) within the same project using the target_link_libraries command. For example, if you have an executable in the same CMakeLists.txt file:"

    "In CMake, the `target_link_libraries()` command is crucial for defining how different targets (executables, libraries) interact with each other regarding their dependencies. Here's a breakdown of how each keyword (`PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`, `INTERFACE`) affects the usability of linked libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `PRIVATE`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` links against `libutils`, allowing `app` to use all functionalities from `libutils` internally.\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: If `test_project` links against `app`, it **does not inherit** the linkage to `libutils`. Hence, `test_project` cannot directly use any functions or classes from `libutils`. This is because `app` has linked `libutils` as `PRIVATE`, meaning its dependencies are not propagated to other targets that link against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `PUBLIC`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` links against `libutils`, making all functionalities from `libutils` available to `app`. Additionally, this linkage is propagated to `test_project` when it links against `app`.\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: `test_project` can use `libutils'` functions and classes directly because they are inherited through the `PUBLIC` linkage from `app`. This means that the linkage and the associated interface requirements (include paths, compile definitions) are shared with both `app` and any targets linking against `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `INTERFACE`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` does not use the functionalities from `libutils` directly but declares that any targets linking against `app` will require `libutils`.\n",
    "- **Impact on `app`**: `app` itself cannot use functionalities from `libutils` as it is linked via `INTERFACE`, which means \"I don't need this myself, but anyone who uses me will need it.\"\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: `test_project` can use functionalities from `libutils` because `app` specifies that linking against `app` necessitates also linking against `libutils` through `INTERFACE`. Thus, `test_project` is indirectly required to link against `libutils` due to its dependency on `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **`PRIVATE`**: Indicates that the linked library is only required by the target itself, and its dependencies should not be propagated to dependent targets.\n",
    "- **`PUBLIC`**: Suggests that both the target and anything that links to the target will need the linked libraries.\n",
    "- **`INTERFACE`**: Used for dependencies that are not required by the target itself but are necessary for targets that depend on this target.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Appending Include Directories with `list(APPEND EXTRA_INCLUDES \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/MathFunctions\")`**\n",
    "   - This command appends the path to the `MathFunctions` directory, located relative to the project's source directory, to the list variable `EXTRA_INCLUDES`. The `EXTRA_INCLUDES` list is commonly used to specify additional directories where the compiler should look for header files. Including this directory ensures that any file within the project that compiles against the `EXTRA_INCLUDES` list can include headers located in `MathFunctions`.\n",

When set to PRIVATE, the definition is added only to the specified target, MathFunctions, and it does not propagate to other targets that may link against it. This means the definition USE_MYMATH is only available in the source files of MathFunctions, and not in any other targets that might use MathFunctions.\n",

This results in the preprocessor directive #define USE_MYMATH being added to the compilation of all source files of the MathFunctions library.
