If it's a shared library, it would be libyuzhen_function.so, libyuzhen_function.dylib, or yuzhen_function.dll on Linux, macOS, and Windows, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Using `PRIVATE`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` links against `libutils`, allowing `app` to use all functionalities from `libutils` internally.\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: If `test_project` links against `app`, it **does not inherit** the linkage to `libutils`. Hence, `test_project` cannot directly use any functions or classes from `libutils`. This is because `app` has linked `libutils` as `PRIVATE`, meaning its dependencies are not propagated to other targets that link against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `PUBLIC`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` links against `libutils`, making all functionalities from `libutils` available to `app`. Additionally, this linkage is propagated to `test_project` when it links against `app`.\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: `test_project` can use `libutils'` functions and classes directly because they are inherited through the `PUBLIC` linkage from `app`. This means that the linkage and the associated interface requirements (include paths, compile definitions) are shared with both `app` and any targets linking against `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `INTERFACE`\n",
    "- **What happens**: `app` does not use the functionalities from `libutils` directly but declares that any targets linking against `app` will require `libutils`.\n",
    "- **Impact on `app`**: `app` itself cannot use functionalities from `libutils` as it is linked via `INTERFACE`, which means \"I don't need this myself, but anyone who uses me will need it.\"\n",
    "- **Impact on `test_project`**: `test_project` can use functionalities from `libutils` because `app` specifies that linking against `app` necessitates also linking against `libutils` through `INTERFACE`. Thus, `test_project` is indirectly required to link against `libutils` due to its dependency on `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **`PRIVATE`**: Indicates that the linked library is only required by the target itself, and its dependencies should not be propagated to dependent targets.\n",
    "- **`PUBLIC`**: Suggests that both the target and anything that links to the target will need the linked libraries.\n",
    "- **`INTERFACE`**: Used for dependencies that are not required by the target itself but are necessary for targets that depend on this target.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Appending Include Directories with `list(APPEND EXTRA_INCLUDES \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/MathFunctions\")`**\n",
    "   - This command appends the path to the `MathFunctions` directory, located relative to the project's source directory, to the list variable `EXTRA_INCLUDES`. The `EXTRA_INCLUDES` list is commonly used to specify additional directories where the compiler should look for header files. Including this directory ensures that any file within the project that compiles against the `EXTRA_INCLUDES` list can include headers located in `MathFunctions`.\n",
