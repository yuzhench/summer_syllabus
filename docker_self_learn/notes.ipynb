    "1. techical definition of the container: \n",
    "    -   layers of linux based image, application image with configuration\n",
    "    -   layers of stacked images on top of each other \n",
    "        -   the base layer of a container is usually linux base image: Alpine:3.10\n",
    "            - details about alpine: \"Alpine\" usually refers to Alpine Linux, which is a lightweight and security-oriented Linux distribution. Alpine Linux is known for its minimalism, with a small footprint and minimal package dependencies. This makes it ideal for containerized environments where efficiency and security are paramount. Many Docker images are based on Alpine Linux as a foundation because it provides a clean and efficient starting point for building containerized applications.\n",
    "        -   one the top of the base image is the Application image\n",
    "2. usually if you want to use a public offical docker, you can dirrectly run \n",
    "    -   docker run [name of the docker]:[version number]\n",
    "3. want to see all the docker containers:\n",
    "    -   docker ps\n",
    "4. the distanction between inage and container:\n",
    "    -   image: the actual package \n",
    "    -   container: when i pull tha images on my local machine and i actually started, so the application inside actually starts that create the container environment \n",
    "\n",
    "    - when you just pull it from online it is an image, but when you run it then it becomes a container \n",
    "    - one docker only has one container and only has one image \n",
    "        - one image has multiple layers \n",
    "5. when you download the some docker image with the differnt version, since some of the layers are the same, so the second download time will be faster than the first time"

    "3. how to bind the host port to the container port \n",
    "    - when you have two different version of redis images, they are still have the same port. \n",
